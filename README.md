# chakra-frontend-1 (Sample)

This is a minimal sample project created to match the structure you provided. It includes only the landing page and a basic Vite + React + Tailwind setup.

Quick start

1. cd into the project folder:

```powershell
cd c:\Users\mithu\Downloads\test\chakra-frontend-1
```

2. Install dependencies:

```powershell
npm install
```

3. Start dev server:

```powershell
npm run dev
```

Notes

- The landing page references some images (e.g., `/hero1.jpg`). Add your images to the `public/` folder with the same filenames or update the paths in `src/Pages/LandingPage/LandingPage.jsx`.
- Tailwind directives are used in `src/index.css`; ensure you run PostCSS/Tailwind via the Vite dev server ("npm run dev").
- This project doesn't include tests or CI. If you'd like, I can add basic tests or split components into separate files.
